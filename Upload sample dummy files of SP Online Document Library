PowerShell Version:

Ensure that you have PowerShell installed on your machine. The script is compatible with PowerShell 5.1 and later versions.
SharePoint PnP PowerShell Module:

Install the SharePoint PnP PowerShell module. You can install it using the following command:
Install-Module -Name Pnp.PowerShell

SharePoint Online Credentials:
Make sure you have the necessary credentials to connect to the SharePoint Online site. The script uses the -Interactive flag with Connect-PnPOnline, which means it will prompt you for credentials.

Sample Dummy File:
Have a sample dummy file on your local machine at the specified path. The script reads this file and uploads it multiple times to the SharePoint document library.

Ensure that the account used to connect to SharePoint Online has the necessary permissions to upload files to the specified document library.
Correct URL and Library Name:

Provide the correct URL for the SharePoint Online site and ensure that the document library you specify exists on the site.
Windows Environment:

The script is designed for Windows environments. If you are using a different operating system, some commands may need adjustments.
By meeting these prerequisites, you should be able to run the script successfully to upload the dummy file to the specified SharePoint Online document library.
